# Safecracking Timer for Alt1

A lightweight Alt1 app that tracks safecracking cooldowns across all RuneScape safe locations.
It automatically detects successful safe cracks via the in-game chatbox and displays timers, progress bars, and optional tooltip alerts.

This project was originally created by **pertinate**.  
This README documents setup, usage, and deployment so the tool can be maintained long term.

## Features
- Tracks cooldowns for every safe location automatically
- Optional Alt1 tooltip notification when a safe becomes available  
- Add notes to each location

```
